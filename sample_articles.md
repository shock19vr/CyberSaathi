For Managed Service Providers (MSPs), this presents a huge opportunity to expand your service offerings by providing continuous compliance monitoring—helping your clients stay compliant while strengthening their own business.
Regulatory compliance is not optional—it's a critical business necessity for SMBs. However, with millions of businesses struggling to maintain compliance, MSPs have a massive opportunity to step in with continuous compliance monitoring services.
Regulatory compliance is no longer just a concern for large enterprises. Small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) are increasingly subject to strict data protection and security regulations, such as HIPAA, PCI-DSS, CMMC, GDPR, and the FTC Safeguards Rule. However, many SMBs struggle to maintain compliance due to limited IT resources, evolving regulatory requirements, and complex security challenges.

### Content:

The vulnerability in question is CVE-2024-48248 (CVSS score: 8.6), an absolute path traversal bug that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to read files on the target host, including sensitive ones such as "/etc/shadow" via the endpoint "/c/router." It affects all versions of the software prior to version 10.11.3.86570.
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added a high-severity security flaw impacting NAKIVO Backup & Replication software to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation.
The cybersecurity firm further noted that the unauthenticated arbitrary file read vulnerability could be weaponized to obtain all stored credentials utilized by the target NAKIVO solution and hosted on the database "product01.h2.db."
In light of active exploitation, Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies are required to apply the necessary mitigations by April 9, 2025, to secure their networks.
"NAKIVO Backup and Replication contains an absolute path traversal vulnerability that enables an attacker to read arbitrary files," CISA said in an advisory.
Also added to the KEV catalog are two other flaws -
Successful exploitation of the shortcoming could allow an adversary to read sensitive data, including configuration files, backups, and credentials, which could then act as a stepping stone for further compromises.
Last week, Akamai revealed that CVE-2025-1316 is being weaponized by bad actors to target cameras with default credentials in order to deploy at least two different Mirai botnet variants since May 2024.
There are currently no details on how the vulnerability is being exploited in the wild, but the development comes after watchTowr Labs published a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit towards the end of last month. The issue has been addressed as of November 2024 with version v11.0.0.88174.

## 4. Goodbye cables, hello lasers: Alphabet’s plan to outshine Starlink

The internet’s future could be floating through the air – Alphabet’s Taara is betting on laser beams replacing traditional cables, and being a major competitor to Elon Musk’s Starlink.
Global internet infrastructure is set for a disruption as Google’s parent company Alphabet revealed that another company it owns, Taara, will be established as an independent venture, aimed at becoming a major player in the market.
Its flagship product, Taara Lightbridge, is a wireless communications system that transmits data using invisible laser beams.
Unlike traditional fibers, which take years and require high investment to install, Taara transmits data using invisible laser beams and can be set up in just a few hours.
This could be particularly advantageous in remote rural areas where fibreoptic cables are often impractical. It will also make installation cheaper.
With the demand for 5G internet ever increasing, fiber struggles to meet this growing appetite for better bandwidth.
A Taara laser beam is able to travel up to 12 miles, hopping from node to node and bypassing traditional support systems.
Taara could in effect be a maestro of innovation, potentially bridging the digital divide between urban and rural areas, where outreach had previously been bothersome.
These laser-based networks could be commercially available as soon as 2026, which is dependent on an optical phased array chip, which will feature thousands instead of hundreds of miniature light emitters, representing a weighty upgrade.
Notably, Taara’s laser tech evolved from Project Loon, Alphabet’s own initiative that used balloons floating at the edge of space.
Loon was shut down in 2021 due to the complexity of maintaining the floating balloons and its negative environmental impact – defunct balloons would end up in rural regions, on the ground like trash.
Nevertheless, the core technology of Loon remains the same, using lasers and this time without the hindrance of shifting weather patterns affecting the balloon's trajectory.
Taara represents a shift away from an experimental project into a commercially viable option, should the market demand it in the coming months and years.
Concerning urban environments, the speed of 20Gbps rivals and sometimes exceeds fiber-based cables.
The rapid deployment at which these lasers could be utilized in urban areas could be a pivotal moment, especially where scalability is concerned.
Urban growth adjusts at different quotients, and the internet framework can be adapted accordingly.
Smart cities – like Singapore or Helsinki – that leverage technology to improve the quality of life for its residents could use this flexible technology also, and a bonus could be its malleability, especially in cities prone to natural disasters.
However, Taara doesn’t come without its drawbacks. Rain, fog, and dust are known to weaken and block laser beams, so big cities will also have maintenance issues compared to fiber, which is unaffected by these conditions.
High-rise buildings, particularly skyscrapers, may also pose challenges for the deployment of such infrastructure.
The likely future will be that these laser networks will be a complementary solution to fibreoptics, as opposed to fully replacing them.
And of course, there’ll be other competitors in this space. Elon Musk's Starlink is currently the market leader in using low-orbit satellite constellations. Starlink can reach the remotest areas but the service can be expensive.
Amazon’s Project Kuiper is also expected to launch 3,200 satellites to underserved communities, with at least half of these expected to be operational by summer 2026.
The global digital divide is a trillion-dollar challenge, meaning more companies will enter the race to provide affordable, high-speed internet worldwide.

## 5. Algorithmic surveillance helped Amazon crush unionizing effort

The 2021 union vote at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama ended with employees voting against unionizing. A new study says the tech giant manipulated the process using algorithmic tricks.
In April 2021, after most workers in Bessemer, Alabama, voted against joining the union, some workers told the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) that the company had created “an atmosphere of confusion, coercion, and/or fear or reprisals” before the vote. Complaints changed nothing.
Now, in a critical study titled "Weaponizing the Workplace: How Algorithmic Management Shaped Amazon's Antiunion Campaign in Bessemer, Alabama," Teke Wiggin, a researcher at Northwestern University, says that Amazon might have pressured workers to vote in a certain way.
According to Wiggin, Amazon might have leveraged “the specific control technique of algorithmic management to repel (not just prevent) collective action by workers.”
“The findings reveal that employers can weaponize elements or effects of algorithmic management against unions via repurposing devices that algorithmically control workers, engaging in 'algorithmic slack-cutting,' and exploiting patterns of social media activity encouraged by algorithmic management,” the paper says.
What’s “algorithmic slack-cutting?” Wiggin uses the term to describe the softening of the “electronic whip” – automated, software-driven oversight.
When workers are given this proverbial carrot, they allegedly feel such a relief that they think they were awarded a benefit – even though, for example, Amazon’s Time-Off-Task tracking system is hardly respectful to the employees. That’s what happened in Bessemer.
Based on Wiggin’s interviews with 42 workers who said they worked at the Amazon warehouse in Bessemer and transcripts of hearings held by the NLRB, the report also details how Amazon used its A to Z app “to send anti-union messages to workers.”
Amazon workers use the app to clock in and out, request time off, receive company announcements, and more.
Wiggin says he was told that workers were pressured to turn on the app's notifications and then bombarded with “anti-union propaganda.”
Moreover, in Amazon’s case, scanners and computers are “constitutive elements of its algorithmic tracking and disciplinary apparatus,” adds Wiggin. Supervisors monitor workers' performance based on indicators generated by the scanners.
That’s not really news, of course. However, interviewees told Wiggin that Amazon supervisors and HR officers “weaponized” such “algorithmically assisted discipline” to further pressure workers and discourage them from voting to form a union.
As expected, an Amazon spokesperson strongly challenged the study’s findings and suggestions that the company manipulates its workers.
“Like most employers, we do expect employees to be working the majority of the time they’re clocked in, and that’s not an unreasonable expectation,” says a statement sent to The Register.
To be fair, though, Amazon has long been criticized for the quality of its working environment and treatment of its workforce. Unsurprisingly, workers of this particular corporation have attempted to form trade unions and defend their rights.
But the giant has fiercely opposed unionization drives, especially in its infamous warehouses.
In 2018, Amazon even distributed union-busting training videos, telling managers to watch out for signs of worker organization, such as employees “suddenly hanging out together” or showing interest in concepts like “living wage.”
So far, the independent Amazon Labor Union, representing some 5,500 workers in Staten Island, NY, is the only such organization of Amazon workers.
The company – which is the second largest employer in the US, employing more than 1.5 million workers across the world, has refused to recognize the union and continues to legally challenge its very existence.

## 6. Americans ditch doomscrolling for $130 worth of monthly streaming

With streaming platforms now wanting you to pay for content even when they show you ads, consumers keep spending more on subscriptions. They’re not happy, a new survey shows.
The poll, commissioned by Tubi, a streaming service, found that American consumers are spending significantly more money on streaming subscriptions than the year before – $129 combined in a month on average. That’s a 7.5% increase.
Indeed, Americans are avid streamers. Thirty-eight percent of respondents said they stream for three hours or more in one sitting, and viewers are juggling nearly seven platforms. In fact, they spend more on streaming than on clothes ($109) each month.
That’s probably why 56% also said they monitor their use of streaming services carefully to avoid overspending. Gen Z viewers seem particularly cost-conscious, as 76% of them said they have or would cancel their membership if the price increased.
The findings can seem a little weird because most larger streamers began offering cheaper ad-supported plans. Shouldn’t the combined monthly sum people spend on streaming be lower?
Well, it turns out viewers don’t really like ads – or, rather, the fact that on most platforms, they still have to play even though ads interrupt their shows a few times. That’s why consumers decide to pay up and escape ads altogether.
Forty-six percent of respondents said that ads significantly disrupt their streaming experience, and 79% said: “If I’m paying for a streaming service, I expect no ads at all.”
Plus, ads sort of return the viewer to everyday struggles. This is offputting for many, with the survey finding that most people turn to streaming as a form of escapism. Eighty percent of viewers said they’d rather spend their time watching something than doomscrolling through social media.
Among the various forms of escapism at our fingertips today, consumers are most likely to reach for streaming when they need a mental break (59%) – followed by listening to music (50%) and scrolling social media (38%).
Many, especially Gen Z viewers, also use streaming as background for other daily tasks, including work, by the way. Eighty-four percent of employed Gen Z viewers say they watch TV or movies while working, and 48% say they’ve lied to co-workers or bosses about it.
What’s more, half of Gen Z (53%) say they have put off working because they had to finish a show they were binge-watching, and 52% say they don’t want to return to the office because they’ll miss streaming during the workday.
